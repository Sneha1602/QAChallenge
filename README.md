# What is this about?
This challenge is part of the KINEXON interview process for QA engineers. 
It gives you the opportunity to show us your skills and how you work in general.
You can decide what you want to focus on, which tools you want to use and how much time you would like to invest.

It is not expected that you build a lot of stuff and that everything is 100% polished.
Simply try to give us a glimpse of what we can expect from you.

# What it includes
The given application emulates a simple web-shop with a few quality issues.
On the landing page, different products can be added to a cart by clicking the 'add to cart' icon.
The shopping cart can then be reached via the 'Go to cart' button in the top right corner.
The following page allows the user to validate the items in the cart and then to proceed to checkout, where the user enters necessary information and completes the order.

## Tasks
1. Add one or more end-to-end tests covering at least the path of adding products to the cart and completing the order.
2. Report all bugs that you find in the application. For that you can use text files and the bug_reports directory (empty by default).

# How to start the app
Please check that you have node.js and npm installed on your system and npm and node are available in your path.
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
Run `ng serve` for starting the server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`


## Good luck :)
